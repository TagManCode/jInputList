jInputList
==========

Allows a user to add a number of items in an input box, pressing return after each one, to see a list of individual items. Each item can be remove by clicking the 'remove' icon, or by hitting backspace twice. Acts like the recipients box on an email composer.

In the background, these items are added to a hidden input as a comma separated list, making it easy to send to the server.

Items that are retrieved from the server and placed in the hidden box will automatically be added to the visible box, as individual items, once jInputList is initialised.

Was asked by a client to create this, and then felt it was handy enough to put on here for anyone.
